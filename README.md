This app has been largely inspired by the blog posts [Securing Clojure Microservices using buddy](http://rundis.github.io/blog/2015/buddy_auth_part1.html).

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][] 2.0.0 or above installed.

[leiningen]: https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen

The app requires a passphrase-protected private key and public key (RSA), to be generated with

```
openssl genrsa -aes128 -out auth_privkey.pem 2048
openssl rsa -pubout -in auth_privkey.pem -out auth_pubkey.pem
```

These should be moved to the resources/ folder. Ensure the that the key names match those in `resources/conf.edn` under `:auth-conf`.

There should also be a configuration file in the home directory called `.secrets.edn` , with following structure:

```
{
  :dev-passphrase "secret-key-you-used-to-create-pems"
}
```

The app has one significant URL: '/create-auth-token' which takes a username and password parameter in json format.

## Development

You can add seed data for development using the following command:

```
lein seed development
```

## Deployment on mesos

Assuming that mesos is running on AWS architecture.
docker build an image with an extra argument to specify the S3 bucket the secrets are stored in.

```
docker build --build-arg SECRETS_BUCKET=<bucket> -t mastodonc/kixi.heimdall .
```

The deployment file to post to marathon can be built using the deploy.sh script


```
./scripts/deploy.sh <mesos-admin-lb> staging mastodonc/kixi.heimdall
```
(substituting mastodonc/kixi.heimdall in the snippets above by the desired docker image name)

## Running

Heimdall uses docker and docker-compose to manage external dependencies in development:

```
docker-compose up
```
Wait until the system has settled before proceeding.
To supress InfluxDB warnings:

```
curl -G -X POST http://localhost:8086/query --data-urlencode "q=CREATE DATABASE metrics"
```

To start the application, run:

```
lein run -m kixi.heimdall.bootstrap -p <development/production>
```
